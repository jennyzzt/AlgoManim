# Customizations

## Adding Customizations I
There are many types of customizations that can be added to the default animation generated by the library. The easiest of which are `global` customizations which can be applied to all animations before the `algoconstruct()` begins. These customizations are added by overriding the `preconfig(self, settings)` method and changing the values directly on the dictionary as seen below.  

```python
from manimlib.imports import *
from algomanim.algoscene import AlgoScene
from algomanim.algolist import AlgoList
from algomanim.settings import Shape

class DefaultBubbleSortScene(AlgoScene):
    def preconfig(scene, settings):
        settings['font_color'] = BLACK
        settings['highlight_color'] = "#e74c3c" # red
        settings['node_color'] = PURPLE
        settings['node_shape'] = Shape.CIRCLE
        settings['node_size'] = 0.5
    
    ...
```

## Adding Customizations II
While your algorithm executes in `algoconstruct`, the library compiles a list of manim animations `action_pairs` which are then rendered after the algorithm finishes into a video. This allows you to then directly edit the animations generated by us by overriding the `customize(self, action_pairs)` method.  
  
The types of customizations you can make here are:
- timeline changes (`fast_forward`, `skip`)
- change colors of specific animations (to emphasize edge-cases for example) (`set_color`)
- add new animations
  - pause (`add_wait`)
  - fade out (`add_fade_out_all`)
  - fade in (`add_fade_in_all`)

You can see this happening in the code snippet given below:
```python
...
class DefaultBubbleSortScene(AlgoScene):
    ...
    def customize(self, action_pairs):
        # 1) color of highlight is changed for first iteration of algorithm
        highlight_pairs = self.find_action_pairs(
            method='compare', occurence=1, lower_level='highlight')

        for action_pair in highlight_pairs:
            action_pair.set_color('#ff6666') # pylint: disable=E0602

        # 2) all animations till the 10th iteration of compare
        # are fast forwarded (2x speed)
        compare_pair = self.find_action_pairs(
            method='compare', occurence=10
        )[0]
        compare_index = compare_pair.get_index()
        self.fast_forward(0, compare_index - 1)

        # 3) Add Custom Transforms into the list to be rendered in runtime
        self.add_fade_out_all(compare_index)

        # 4) insert a wait between iterations
        self.add_wait(compare_index + 1)

        # 5) skip remaining animations from third iteration till the end
        self.skip(compare_index + 2)

        self.add_fade_in_all(len(action_pairs))
```
### Finding Indices
As you have seen above, the customization functions require you to provide an index in the list. A helper function (`find_action_pairs`) has been provided for your convenience so that you are able to edit the animations which you would like to by specifying the method that the animation was generated by. This can be seen in the line `self.find_action_pairs(method='compare', occurence=1, lower_level='highlight')` which finds the animations generated when `compare` was called for the `1`st time. In fact we are able to specify the specific animation inside `compare`, `highlight` that we want to edit.  

Please note that these names and numbers can be identified by inspecting the timeline in the GUI.
