# Introduction to AlgoManim

## Installation
Please read the `README.md` in the root directory for installation instructions.

## Overview of the Codebase
| Directory | Content Description |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `algomanim/` | Library containing implementations of Data Structures and Animations |
| `algomanim_examples/` | Various examples showing how to use AlgoManim library |
| `gui/` | AlgoManim GUI Source Code |
| `manim_example/` | Animations written in pure manim for reference |
| `tests/` | Tests |

## Examples
Examples that show the usage of the customizations and data structures that we support currently are provided in the `algomanim_examples/` folder. If you would like to get a quick overview of all the features we provide, please see `algomanim_examples/binarytreesort.py`.

## First Program
The simplest algomanim program, only requires a single python file with a class that extends `AlgoScene` and overrides the `algoconstruct(self)` method (as seen below). This scene, implements the BubbleSort Algorithm.

```python
from manimlib.imports import *
from algomanim.algoscene import AlgoScene
from algomanim.algolist import AlgoList
from algomanim.settings import Shape

class DefaultBubbleSortScene(AlgoScene):
    def algo(self):
        algolist = AlgoList(self, [25, 43, 5, 18, 30])
        swaps_made = True
        while swaps_made:
            swaps_made = False
            for i in range(algolist.len() - 1):
                j = i + 1
                if algolist.compare(i, j):
                    swaps_made = True
                    algolist.swap(i, j)
```
To run this program, simply type `python3 -m manim algomanim_examples/bubblesort_default.py' DefaultBubbleSortScene -pl`. The animation will automatically play once it is rendered.

## Next Steps
Please read `Customizations.md` to find out more about how to customize the animations generated by us and `DataStructures.md` to find out more about the operations on data structures currently supported.
